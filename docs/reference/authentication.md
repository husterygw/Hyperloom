# Hyperloom authentication and credentials

This is the single authoritative reference for credentials and
environment configuration in Hyperloom. If any other document
(`README.md`, `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md`,
`docs/reference/kernel-execution-path.md`,
`src/hyperloom/agents/robustness/SKILL.md`) appears to contradict this
page, this page wins. Open an issue against the contradicting file.

```{note}
Shell paths on this page follow the recommended `pip install --target .` layout.
In a source checkout, replace the `hyperloom/` prefix with `src/hyperloom/`.
The command blocks assume `REPO_ROOT` points at that workspace. No installer
exports it for you, so run `export REPO_ROOT="$(pwd -P)"` from the workspace
first — it does not survive a new shell.
```

Hyperloom needs at most two classes of configuration:

- **LLM credentials**: Either at least one gateway provider side, configured
   with both its base URL and its own key, or an explicit
   `--codex-cli-auth` opt-in to an existing `codex login` session (see
   [Codex CLI ChatGPT authentication](#codex-cli-chatgpt-authentication)).
- **Path / workspace layout**: Run bare-metal setup from the installed
   Hyperloom target directory. You normally only set `USER_DATA_PATH`
   (writable artifact root; defaults to `/workspace/hyperloom` when `/workspace`
   is writable, otherwise to `session/` under the current directory); setup
   writes the runtime env files and updates `.env`.

Hyperloom never borrows one provider's key or endpoint for the other. A side is
configured by `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or by
`OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or both. A side you leave unset
disables the features that speak its protocol; a half-configured side fails
preflight rather than being silently completed from the other provider.

The only values still filled for you are the internal LLM aliases
(`LLM_API_KEY`, `AMD_LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_API_BASE`), which the inference optimizer
CLI preflight copies from the OpenAI side. You do not set those by hand.
`GEAK_API_KEY` / `GEAK_BASE_URL` are never filled from either side: GEAK runs on
the Anthropic side, so set them only to point GEAK at something else.

---

## Credential precedence

Hyperloom reads credentials from two places, in order:

| Source                                      | When used                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Process environment (`export FOO=...`)      | Always — wins unconditionally.                            |
| `$REPO_ROOT/.env`                           | Only for keys missing from the process environment.       |

Shell environment variables always win over `.env`.
Both the inference optimizer CLI dotenv loader and
`src/hyperloom/agents/kernel/scripts/install.sh` honor this rule. Do *not*
manually `source .env` from chat — it inverts the precedence and can
overwrite an exported key with a stale value from disk.

A key is considered "set" in `.env` if the line is uncommented and the
value is non-empty. Empty / commented lines are ignored; the
shell-exported value (if any) is kept.

If neither source supplies a usable LLM endpoint (at least one of
`OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and at least one of
`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` /
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), the CLI fails fast at startup
with a message naming the missing pieces. The explicit `--codex-cli-auth` mode
is the exception: it validates an existing Codex CLI login instead of requiring
an endpoint and API key.

Preflight also rejects a *mispaired* configuration: a base URL whose only key
belongs to the other provider, or a key whose only endpoint would come from the
other provider. Hyperloom would otherwise send that key to a foreign host. Give
each side its own `*_BASE_URL` and key, or drop the foreign key.

---

## Codex CLI ChatGPT authentication

For a local Codex-driven run, first authenticate the installed CLI once, then
opt in on each optimizer launch:

```bash
codex login
python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli optimize \
    --codex-cli-auth \
    --target nvidia_rtx4090_8x_local \
    --model /path/to/model \
    --framework vllm
```

This mode needs neither `OPENAI_API_KEY` nor `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. It is explicit:
an ambient login is ignored unless `--codex-cli-auth` or
`HYPERLOOM_CODEX_CLI_AUTH=1` is set. If complete OpenAI gateway credentials are
also present, the gateway wins so a stale CLI session cannot silently change
the selected provider.

Hyperloom validates the CLI `auth.json` before use: the path must be a regular,
non-symlink file owned exclusively by the current user, limited to 1 MiB, and
contain a usable ChatGPT token record. Each agent receives a mode-`0600` copy in
a private temporary `CODEX_HOME`; the copy is removed at teardown. Sandbox
selection is separate from authentication and is documented under
[Codex CLI authentication and agent sandbox](environment-variables.md#codex-openai-cli-authentication-and-agent-sandbox).

---

## LLM gateway credentials

A provider side is configured by **both** its base URL and its own key. Exactly
three shapes are accepted; anything else fails preflight.

| Shape | Set | Effect |
|-------|-----|--------|
| OpenAI side only | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Codex runs; Claude and GEAK are disabled |
| Anthropic side only | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude and GEAK run; Codex (OpenAI-protocol) is disabled |
| Both sides | all four, each side self-consistent | Everything runs |

One gateway serving both providers is the third shape: point both base URLs at
it and set both keys, even when the key value is the same.

| Variable             | Issuer                | Where to obtain                                                             | Format              |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL`    | Your LiteLLM gateway  | `https://<your-gateway-host>/api/v1/llm-proxy/v1` (adjust to your gateway)  | URL ending in `/v1` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Your LiteLLM gateway  | Your gateway's LLM Gateway page                                             | `ak-...`            |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Your gateway / Anthropic | Same gateway without the trailing `/v1`, or `https://api.anthropic.com`  | URL                 |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | Your gateway / Anthropic | Your gateway's page, or the Anthropic console                            | `ak-...` / `sk-ant-...` |

Downstream tooling reads the side it belongs to:

* GEAK runs Claude Code, so it uses the Anthropic-side base URL + key plus
  `GEAK_CLAUDE_MODEL`. An OpenAI-only deployment cannot start it.
* Kernel tools inherit the OpenAI-side credential from preflight
  (`LLM_API_KEY` / `AMD_LLM_API_KEY`).
* Orchestration Claude uses the Anthropic-side base URL + key, including the
  generated `~/.claude/config.json` primary key.
* Robustness-agent uses whichever side it discovers for the optional LLM RCA
  engine, preferring the OpenAI side and falling back to the Anthropic one.
* Critic-agent uses the OpenAI side for KB summary / synthesis calls.

You *never* need to copy a key into the internal LLM slots in `.env`;
preflight fills those from the OpenAI-side key. Preflight does **not** cross-fill
the per-provider primary keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`), and an explicitly set provider key is never overwritten.

The recommended setup, run once per shell:

```bash
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env: set the base URL + key for each side you want enabled.
```

For one-off use without writing to disk:

```bash
# One gateway serving both providers: configure both sides against it.
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://<your-gateway-host>/api/v1/llm-proxy/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=ak-your-gateway-apikey
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://<your-gateway-host>/api/v1/llm-proxy
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=ak-your-gateway-apikey
```

Dropping the two `ANTHROPIC_*` lines is also valid — it just disables the
Claude-side features.

### Split entrypoints (native Anthropic + OpenAI)

Use when Claude and GPT live on different upstream vendors or gateways.
Set each side explicitly.

| Variable              | Side      | Example                         |
|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`  | Claude    | `https://api.anthropic.com`     |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`   | Claude    | `sk-ant-...`                    |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL`     | Codex/GPT | `https://api.openai.com/v1`     |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`      | Codex/GPT | `sk-...`                        |

Preflight resolves `(anthropic_base_url, openai_base_url)` independently: each
side is its own explicit base URL, or the official SDK endpoint implied by that
side's own key, or empty. Claude CLI auth uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`); GEAK uses the same Anthropic-side URL and key. Neither
side is ever completed from the other.

To pin models in split mode:

```bash
export CLAUDE_MODEL=orchestration-model-id-on-the-anthropic-side
export CODEX_MODEL=model-id-on-the-openai-side
```

### Anthropic-side credential forms

The Anthropic side accepts three credentials. When more than one is set, the
Claude CLI picks the first of these it finds, so a lower one is unused:

| Variable                  | Billing                        | Obtained from        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | API credits                    | Anthropic console / your gateway |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`    | API credits (gateway bearer)   | Your gateway         |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Claude Max/Pro subscription    | `claude setup-token` |

A subscription token alone is a complete Anthropic side: it implies
`https://api.anthropic.com`, so `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` can stay unset. Hyperloom
passes it through verbatim and never copies it into either API-key variable or
into the `~/.claude/config.json` `primaryApiKey` field, because the CLI would
then bill API credits instead of the subscription. For the same reason preflight
warns when a token and an API key are set together. A subscription token is also
not accepted by the gateway model-catalog probe, so preflight skips that probe
and trusts the model id you passed.

### Non-AMD / self-hosted gateway

Point `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or the split keys above) at
your own LiteLLM-compatible gateway (Vultr, TensorWave, on-prem, etc.) and
pin models your gateway actually serves:

```bash
export CLAUDE_MODEL=your-gateway-orchestration-model
export CODEX_MODEL=your-gateway-kernel-model
```

Custom orchestration models are allowed by default: preflight validates the
chosen `CLAUDE_MODEL` against your gateway's `/models` catalog. To restore the
stricter AMD Claude allowlist (`claude-opus-5` preferred, `claude-opus-4-8` /
`claude-opus-4-7` / `claude-opus-4-6` fallback), set
`INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_ALLOW_CUSTOM_ORCH_MODEL=0`.

A gateway that exposes no `/models` route cannot be probed; preflight warns and
proceeds instead of refusing to start, so no opt-in is needed for that case.

### Gateways that require extra headers

Some enterprise gateways authenticate on a header of their own — Azure API
Management's `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`, a corporate proxy's tenant header — in
addition to, or instead of, the bearer key. AMD's own `llm-api.amd.com` gateway
is one of them: it requires the API key to also travel as an
`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header, which the guided setup writes for you when
you pick that gateway. Supply it per side with `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` or
`OPENAI_CUSTOM_HEADERS`. Both accept the Anthropic SDK's newline-delimited
`Name: value` form, and a JSON object as a convenience for launchers that already
store structured values.

`${VAR}` references are expanded by Hyperloom from the same environment, so a
single copy of the secret is enough. Quote the value so the space and the colon
survive: use single quotes when exporting in a shell, and double quotes in
`.env`, which setup and the launch scripts might load with `source`.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://<your-gateway-host>/api/v1/llm-proxy
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=ak-your-gateway-apikey
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS='Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}'
```

The Anthropic side reads only `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`. The OpenAI side reads
`OPENAI_CUSTOM_HEADERS` whenever you set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` explicitly — that
endpoint might be a different host, whose headers Hyperloom will not guess at. Only
when the OpenAI base URL was *derived* from `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (one gateway, no
explicit OpenAI endpoint) does the OpenAI client fall back to
`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`, because then both protocols are the same host and the
subscription header was only ever written to the Anthropic variable. Headers are
operator-supplied either way and are never synthesized from the configured keys.

Both survive in `.env` across setup runs. An Anthropic-only deployment is the one
exception: setup scrubs the whole OpenAI side there, header included, because that
side is a second provider rather than part of the same gateway credential.

---

## Optional credentials

The following credentials are optional and only needed for specific backends.

### LLM RCA in robustness-agent

`robustness-agent`'s LLM root-cause-analysis engine activates when the
discovered provider can actually authenticate a call. For the OpenAI side, that
is a base URL and API key (normally through the aliases above). For the
Anthropic side, it's a usable transport, so a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` host
qualifies with neither a base URL nor a key — the Claude CLI spends the token
itself — provided that CLI is installed.

Set `ROBUSTNESS_LLM_RCA_DISABLED=1` to force-disable it even when
credentials are present.

## Path environment

These are *not* secrets. You normally do not hand-export
`INFERENCEX_PATH` or `TRACELENS_ROOT` — `install.sh` and its chained
kernel-agent installer clone and pin the open-source checkouts when missing.
Runtime paths are persisted into `.env` by the installer; the CLI preflight
loads them and derives `PATH` / `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` from `ROCM_PATH` /
`VIRTUAL_ENV` / `VLLM_VENV_ROOT` at launch, so no separate file needs sourcing.

### Workspace variables

| Variable               | Set by operator? | Default                                          | Description                                                                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `USER_DATA_PATH`       | recommended      | `/workspace/hyperloom` if `/workspace` is writable, else `<cwd>/session` | Writable root for session dirs, `runtime/`, `logs/`, optimizer artifacts. Bare-metal hosts without a writable `/workspace` take the second form, which is also what setup offers. |
| `REPO_ROOT`            | rarely           | auto-detected from script location               | This Hyperloom checkout. Locates `.env`, skills, scripts.                                                        |
| `KERNEL_AGENT_ENV`     | rarely           | `$USER_DATA_PATH/runtime/kernel-agent.env.sh`    | Output of `install.sh`; exports resolved paths and LLM aliases.                                                  |
| `HYPERLOOM_RUNTIME_DIR`| rarely           | `$USER_DATA_PATH/runtime`                        | Shared runtime tree (env files, GEAK config, Recipe KB bookkeeping).                                             |

### Dependency checkout variables

Open-source dependencies default under `HYPERLOOM_CACHE_DIR`
(`$REPO_ROOT/.cache`), cloned per revision as `<name>@<sha>`. The cache is
repo-local and writable, so open-source runs need no privileged `/opt` mount.

Leave these variables unset unless you maintain your own checkouts. An
explicit path pointing at a missing directory fails preflight.

| Variable                     | Set by operator? | Default / auto-clone target                                | Description                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HYPERLOOM_CACHE_DIR`        | rarely           | `$REPO_ROOT/.cache`                                        | Writable, repo-local root for open-source deps (TraceLens, InferenceX, GEAK), cloned per revision as `<name>@<sha>`. |
| `INFERENCEX_PATH`            | optional override | `${HYPERLOOM_CACHE_DIR:-$REPO_ROOT/.cache}/InferenceX@<sha>` | [SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX) for baseline and target analysis; the inference_optimizer installer (`src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh`) clones it when unset. |
| `TRACELENS_ROOT`             | optional override | `${HYPERLOOM_CACHE_DIR:-$REPO_ROOT/.cache}/TraceLens@<sha>` | [AMD-AGI/TraceLens](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens) for profiling and kernel detection; the kernel-agent installer clones and pins it when unset. |
| `TRACELENS_INTERNAL_ROOT`    | optional         | unset (MAF measured on-device)                             | Optional internal TraceLens extension that backfills MAF without an on-device benchmark. When unset, Hyperloom measures MAF on an idle GPU (microbenchmark) — roofline gap / MI355+ MAF analysis is still produced, just measured locally. Hyperloom never clones it. |
| `MAGPIE_PATH`                | optional override | Resolved from installed `Magpie` package                  | Magpie package root for benchmark wrappers and patch inspection. `install.sh` pip-installs Magpie from `MAGPIE_PACKAGE_SPEC` when it is not importable. |

## Direct upstream wiring

Claude, Codex, and GEAK talk to the configured upstream gateway directly.
The AMD primus-safe gateway accepts both header styles natively.

At preflight, the inference optimizer CLI:

- Resolves Anthropic and OpenAI base URLs.
- Writes `~/.claude/config.json`: `customApiUrl` is set to the resolved
  Anthropic-side base URL, and `primaryApiKey` to the Anthropic-side key
  (explicit `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` wins, else
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`). A `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is never written here.
- Fills the internal LLM aliases from the OpenAI-side key for child processes;
  the per-provider primary keys and the GEAK aliases are not filled.

**401 recovery:**

1. Confirm `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and the matching
   API key are set and current.
2. Re-run preflight (any `python -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli ...` command) or
   `bash "$REPO_ROOT/hyperloom/agents/kernel/scripts/install.sh" --check-only`.
3. Inspect `~/.claude/config.json` — `customApiUrl` must point at the
   resolved Anthropic-side upstream gateway.

GEAK uses the generated runtime configuration directly.

## Hosted mode (Primus-Claw)

When you launch through the hosted Hyperloom UI,
you do not need to set any of the variables above by hand. The
sandbox initializer binds your LLM Gateway key as `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, populates the path env from sandbox defaults, and runs
install/preflight so downstream tools inherit the gateway URL and aliases.

---

## FAQ

These questions cover common credential configuration scenarios.

**Q: Do I have to put my key in `.env`?**

No. Exporting credentials in your shell is sufficient. `.env` is a
convenience for persistence between shells.

**Q: I exported `OPENAI_API_KEY` but `.env` has a different value. Which wins?**

The exported (shell) value wins. `.env` only fills missing keys.

**Q: Can I use separate provider keys instead of one shared gateway key?**

Yes, in split-entrypoint mode: set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`
(and the matching base URLs) for each side. See
[Split entrypoints](#split-entrypoints-native-anthropic--openai).

**Q: Where do provider-specific API keys come from?**

From each side's own variable: the OpenAI side reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the
Anthropic side reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`). Neither is
derived from the other. One gateway serving both protocols still needs both set,
even when the value is identical.

**Q: My organization rotates the LLM gateway key weekly. How?**

Re-export the key(s) and re-run `install.sh` (idempotent). Preflight
and all aliases pick up the new value on the next CLI launch.
