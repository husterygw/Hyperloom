"""Shared workload-env materialization (single source of truth).

This module is the single source of truth for rendering a Magpie YAML with the
user's actual process-env workload contract, so the baseline and grid-runner
paths render identical YAML:

* :func:`materialize_config_with_envs` — write a per-run YAML honoring process
  env (+ optional caller overrides).
* :func:`default_baseline_config` — pick the shipped YAML by ``$FRAMEWORK``.

Used by ``baseline.py`` (materializes once, surfaces the path) and the
``explore`` / ``sweep`` grid runs (fall back to materializing on their own).

:func:`~._server_argv.seal_server_argv` settles the server argument string at
the end of :func:`materialize_config_with_envs`; nothing may write it after.

       first-request aiter JIT compile survives (the 300s default fires
       SIGQUIT mid-warmup on a cold aiter cache).

    Steps 1-4b are sglang-scoped; steps 5 and 6 are vLLM/atom-scoped. The
    inline comments below carry the per-step rationale.

    """Render a per-run Magpie YAML with caller-provided overrides.

    Process env wins over YAML defaults: ``MODEL_PATH`` → ``benchmark.model``;
    ``GPU_TYPE`` → ``runner_type`` + pinned generic ``{framework}_{gpu_type}.sh``
    (so Magpie doesn't fall through to a native script hardcoding
    ``--result-dir /workspace/``); ``benchmark_script`` (pre-sanitized) re-pins
    after that; ``PRECISION`` → ``precision``; ``CONC/ISL/OSL/MAX_MODEL_LEN/TP/PP/
    RANDOM_RANGE_RATIO`` → ``benchmark.envs``; the target-specific visible
    device mask is reconciled against ``TP*PP``; ``RUN_EVAL`` defaulted; ``NUM_PROMPTS`` /
    ``NUM_WARMUPS`` computed adaptively. ``inferencex_path`` explicitly pins
    ``benchmark.inferencex_path`` for one task (falling back to
    ``$INFERENCEX_PATH`` for existing callers). ``extra_server_args`` routes
    into the framework env; ``--extra-env`` is copied into ``benchmark.envs``
    so Magpie forwards it to vLLM/sglang workers; ``extra_envs`` overrides any
    of the above.
    The session's ``--reference-script`` recipe is read from SharedState here
    rather than passed in, so it seeds a lowest-priority base (below the YAML
    base and ``extra_server_args``) for every caller.

    Args:
        config_path: Path to the source Magpie YAML to render.
        output_dir: Directory the materialized YAML is written into.
        extra_server_args: Extra framework server args merged into the env.
        extra_envs: Overrides applied last over any computed env values;
            shell/loader hijack names and credentials are dropped.
        remove_args: Inherited framework server args to remove before launch.
        unset_envs: Env names to remove after applying ``extra_envs``;
            workload pins are refused.
        args_mode: ``"append"`` (default) or ``"replace"`` for
            ``extra_server_args``.
        model_path: Model path/id; overrides ``benchmark.model`` when set.
        gpu_type: GPU type; sets ``runner_type`` and pins the generic script.
        inferencex_path: Explicit InferenceX checkout to pin into the YAML.
        benchmark_script: Pre-sanitized benchmark script name to re-pin.
        out_name: File name for the materialized YAML.
        establish_quality_ref: When True (baseline only) the scriptable
            image-quality reference is ESTABLISHED (written) by this run;
            otherwise the run only COMPARES against it. See the quality-
            reference wiring block below.
        drop_moe_runner_backend: When True, skip the AMD MoE
            ``--moe-runner-backend`` injection and strip the flag from the
            merged args whatever source it came from (the one-shot fallback
            after a launch failure blamed on that backend).
        flydsl_source_dirs: When True, name the FlyDSL source roots in
            ``$FLYDSL_EXTRA_SOURCE_DIRS`` so a patched helper invalidates the JIT
            cache key. Off by default: only a run that applied such a patch needs it.
        agentx_mode: Explicit session-level AgentX decision. ``None`` preserves
            the legacy environment-based fallback.

    Returns:
        The materialized YAML path (stable file name across calls).

    Raises:
        FrameworkScriptMismatchError: If ``benchmark_script`` targets a
            different known framework than the run's framework.
