    """Make forge GEMM tuned CSVs durable + recipe-portable.

    The forge KEEP references tuned CSVs by their ephemeral tuner-workspace paths,
    so a recipe replayed after the workspace is gone (or on another box) loses the
    tuning and aiter falls back to its default config. Mirror integrate_patch's
    durability: copy each CSV into the serving aiter config tree, repoint the env
    there, and snapshot the realized files via :func:`snapshot_source_layer` so
    they travel with the recipe.

    The copy lands one level below ``configs/model_configs/`` on purpose. aiter
    merges every ``model_configs/*{table}*.csv`` it can glob whenever the env var
    is unset, and that glob is not recursive. Writing directly into that
    directory would hand the table to every later server start -- including after
    E2E rejected the candidate, and including servers for other models, since the
    scan does not discriminate by model. Replay does not need the scan: it
    restores the env var explicitly (see ``prelude._warm_kernel_extra_envs``) and
    defers a GEMM column that has no env at all.

    The snapshot lands under ``<session_dir>/optimization_stack/src/`` (the same
    durable, run-cleanup-surviving location integrate_patch uses) -- NOT under the
    ephemeral ``runs/gemm_tuning`` workspace, which would be cleaned away and
    defeat the cross-environment recipe-portability this exists for.

    Best-effort: on any error the env is returned unchanged (never breaks the KEEP).

    Same shape, and the same root cause, as
    :func:`_cold_start_rebaseline_timeout`: the explicit ``timeout_sec`` that
    integrate passes suppresses the baseline executor's own AgentX branch, so a
    value sized for the synthetic shape becomes the only budget the round gets.
    Observed values are 7200s and 9000s; a canonical AgentX warmup is 10
    requests per lane over real agentic traces and does not fit either.

    Measured on Qwen3.8: a round whose server answered all 685
    chat/completions with 200 was cut at exactly its 7200s param, mid-warmup,
    after which the client could no longer connect. Nothing in the abort reason
    names the timeout -- aiperf reports the cancelled warmup credit as
    ``warmup_failure``, so it reads as a workload problem.

    Raised here, where the param is produced, rather than in the executor that
    consumes it: ``_resolve_timeout`` deliberately lets an explicit param
    outrank the AgentX derivation, and that contract has a test on it. AgentX
    is an opt-in branch, so with it disabled this returns ``resolved_sec``
    untouched and the default path is unaffected.
