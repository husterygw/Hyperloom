"""PolicyGate — the single chokepoint every parsed Intent passes before any side effect.

The gate decides synchronously from the intent, the role registry and static
config, and makes no database call. Three rules need resources it cannot read
-- the bring-up round holding the machine, a specialist's GPU request and a
lease extension -- and take their answer from ``policy/projection.py``. Those
refusals are labelled advisory because they are read off a snapshot rather than
off the resource, and they deny: the acquire at the side-effect boundary is the
second gate, not the first one.
